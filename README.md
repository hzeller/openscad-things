Some random things with no claim of usefulness :) Mostly for me to dump
some designs I want to share somewhere.

   - cello-endpin-holder: holds the endpin of a cello ([here an early version] (https://plus.google.com/u/0/+HennerZeller/posts/4s14tKttz5i))
   - dimension-bracket: simpler ruler for printer adjustment
   - scope phone adapter: an [adapter for my MotoX phone to my microscope](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+HennerZeller/posts/9eWFhvYqgtb)
   - snap joint test: little test to see how things can be snap joint (not
     terribly successful yet).
   - spool-holder: necessity - an axis adaptor for spools.
   - stacked-spool-holder: stack of spool holders, mount on top of printer.
   - webcam-hood: a hood for my Logitec C920 webcam.
